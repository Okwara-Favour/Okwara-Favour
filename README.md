## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Favour Okwara

# About me
I am a passionate web, game developer and artist. A huge fan of Unity, Blender, Eclipse, VS/VSCode, and any software that does not give me a headache. If I am not modelling, drawing or programming, I can be found at a gym where I release my frustations after playing chess with bugs, at a beach, or jogging around your neighborhood.

- ðŸ¥± I recently built a web application that keeps track of time spent learning some topic, check it out [here](https://github.com/Okwara-Favour/StudyTracker).
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a 3d game upgrade for a previous 2d gamejam project I contributed to, [Stables In The Stable](https://itch.io/jam/uvgd-2025-reading-break-jam/rate/3355125)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to solo or collaborate on anything that sounds fun.
  - Send ideas to okwarafavour13@yahoo.com  
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting a job if you don't mind.
