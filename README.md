## Hi there 👋, my name is Favour Okwara

# About me
I am a passionate web, game developer and artist 😃. A huge fan of Unity, Blender, Eclipse, VS/VSCode, and any software that does not give me a headache. If I am not modelling, drawing or programming, I can be found at a gym where I release my frustations after playing chess with bugs 🏋️‍♂️, at a beach 🏖️, or jogging around your neighborhood 🏃‍♂️.
