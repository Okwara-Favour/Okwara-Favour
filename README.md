## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Favour Okwara

# About me
I am a passionate web, game developer and artist. A huge fan of Unity, Blender, Eclipse, VS/VSCode, and any software that does not give me a headache. If I am not modelling, drawing or programming, I can be found at a gym where I release my frustations after playing chess with bugs, at a beach, or jogging around your neighborhood.
