## Hi there 👋, my name is Favour Okwara

# About me
I am a passionate web, game developer and artist 😃. A huge fan of Unity, Blender, Eclipse, VS/VSCode, and any software that does not give me a headache 😅. If I am not modelling, drawing or programming, I can be found at a gym 🏋️‍♂️ where I release my frustations after playing chess with bugs ♟️, at a beach 🏖️, or jogging around your neighborhood 🏃‍♂️.

- 🥱 I recently built a local website that keeps track of time spent learning some topic, check it out [here](https://github.com/Okwara-Favour/StudyTracker).
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a 3d game upgrade for a previous 2d gamejam project I contributed to.
- 👯 I’m looking to solo or collaborate on anything that sounds fun.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with getting a job if you don't mind.
